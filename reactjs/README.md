# Homework for ReactJs

the structure is `<#course>/<#hw>/` so just make sure you get the right path to the homework you are looking for.

Don't forget to change `index.js` in course folder to have the homework display in the UI. Since so far, there is no router injected, you still need to manually modify the component import that you would like to show.
