# Homework for ReactJs

the structure is `<#course>/<#hw>/` so just make sure you get the right path to the homework you are looking for.

Don't forget to change `index.js` in course folder to have the homework display in the UI. Since so far, there is no router injected, you still need to manually modify the component import that you would like to show.

## About Storybook

Storybook is a tool for visual demonstration of React components.

### Install Storybook

I have already put `Storybook` in the `package.json` file, so once you have npm installed, you can run `npm install` to install all the dependencies including `Storybook`.

### Start Storybook

`npm run storybook` will start the Storybook server.

### Notes

I just have U1 to U4 for the course in Storybook, so I don't have any homework for the rest of the course.
The reason is to setup the configuration about React Router is pretty complicated.
As the result, if you would like to check other homeworks besides U1 to U4, you have to manually modify the `index.js` file in the specific folder.
